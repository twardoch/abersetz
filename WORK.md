### Maintenance Snapshot
- Ran full pytest suite (`python -m pytest -xvs`) – 30 passed, 8 skipped, 0 failed; coverage plugin reported 75% overall.
- Cleared ephemeral artifacts (`.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.benchmarks`, `.coverage`, `.DS_Store`).
- No source changes performed this session; repository remains documentation-only modifications.
- 2025-09-21 04:45 UTC — Removed `.pytest_cache`, `.benchmarks`, `.coverage`, and `.ruff_cache` after validation pass.
### Current Iteration Targets
- [x] Normalize engine selector handling with canonical short aliases in config + CLI.
- [x] Refresh CLI engine listings and defaults to present short selectors only.
- [x] Add regression tests covering selector normalization and CLI output updates.
- [x] Add engine listing filters (`--family`, `--configured-only`) and document the UX changes.
- [x] Harden CLI entry points + setup to accept short selectors everywhere and update language listing UX/tests.
- [x] Extend provider discovery metadata using external research and surface pricing hints.
- [x] Refresh documentation and runnable examples to reflect validation workflow.
- [x] Raise coverage by deepening tests for validation flows and setup integration.

### Reliability Boost Sprint – Active
- [x] Enforce pipeline read-permission safeguards (tests/test_pipeline.py)
- [x] Exercise `_persist_output` write-over & voc paths (tests/test_pipeline.py)
- [x] Mock example flows for coverage (tests/test_examples.py)
### Release Readiness Checklist (Completed)
- [x] Raise total coverage to ≥90% by targeting `setup.py`, `openai_lite.py`, and high-miss integration paths.
- [x] Document manual smoke tests (engines, validate, setup, translation) with latest run results.
- [x] Draft release notes summarizing selector overhaul, validation command, and setup improvements.
### Maintenance Sprint Targets
- [x] Expand `validation.py` helper coverage for selector normalization and defaults.
- [x] Extend CLI tests for `validate` and `lang` commands.
- [x] Document validation selector guidance in `docs/cli.md` and cross-links.
### Test Results
- `python -m pytest -xvs` → 56 passed, 8 skipped, 0 failed; coverage plugin emitted 86% overall with `setup.py` (67%) and `openai_lite.py` (60%) still trailing our 90% release target.
- 2025-09-21 04:42 UTC — `python -m pytest -xvs` → 56 passed, 8 skipped; coverage report at 86% overall (per-terminal plugin) with significant gaps remaining in `setup.py` (67%) and `openai_lite.py` (60%).
- 2025-09-21 04:58 UTC — `python -m pytest -xvs` → 74 passed, 8 skipped; coverage climbed to 91% overall with `setup.py` at 93% and residual hotspots in `cli.py` (83%) and `validation.py` (89%).

### Manual Smoke Tests (2025-09-21)
- `python -m abersetz.cli_fast engines` — succeeded; rendered 22 selectors across tr/dt/hy/ll families with expected configuration flags.
- `python -m abersetz.cli_fast validate` — aborted after 60s timeout; translators backends attempt live network calls, needs stubbed selector set for offline smoke testing.
- `python -m abersetz.cli_fast setup --non_interactive True` — aborted after 60s timeout at post-setup validation for the same reason; requires sandboxed validation fixtures before release.
- `python -m abersetz.cli_fast tr es examples/poem_en.txt --dry_run True --engine tr/google` — succeeded; dry-run pipeline enumerated output path without writing files.

### QA Sweep – 2025-09-21
- Ran `python -m pytest -xvs` (78 passed, 8 skipped, 0 failed; coverage plugin snapshot 92% overall, highlighted misses in `cli.py`, `config.py`, `engine_catalog.py`, `engines.py`, `pipeline.py`, `setup.py`).
- Ran `python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing` (92% total coverage; missing lines enumerated for follow-up).
- Ran `uvx mypy .` (74 errors; missing type stubs for pytest/httpx/etc., attr access issues on stubbed classes) — requires dependency stubs and API wrapper adjustments.
- Ran `uvx bandit -r .` (204 Low issues, mostly intentional `assert` usage in tests plus fallback backup handler `try/except/pass`).
- Performed cleanup: removed `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.benchmarks`, `.coverage`.

### Configuration & Catalog Hardening – Completed 2025-09-21
- Added regression coverage for `Defaults.from_dict(None)` and `EngineConfig.from_dict(name, None)` ensuring stripped config sections still yield canonical defaults.
- Strengthened credential conversion tests to assert optional field serialization and TypeError on unsupported payloads.
- Validated deep-translator provider aggregation with include-paid flow to guarantee deterministic, duplicate-free listings.

- [x] Add tests for `_parse_patterns` and `_load_json_data` edge cases.
- [x] Capture empty-state rendering for `_render_engine_entries` and `_render_validation_entries`.
- [x] Exercise `_collect_engine_entries` branches for single-provider configs and ullm profiles.

### Verification – CLI Reliability
- 2025-09-21 05:26 UTC — `python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py -xvs` (14 passed; targeted coverage step confirmed helper behaviour).
- 2025-09-21 05:27 UTC — `python -m pytest -xvs` (83 passed, 8 skipped; coverage 93% overall, `cli.py` now 92%).

### Automated Report – 2025-09-21
- 2025-09-21 05:33 UTC — `python -m pytest -xvs` (83 passed, 8 skipped; coverage plugin summary 93% overall. Initial 10s harness timeout re-run with extended limit.)
- 2025-09-21 05:35 UTC — `python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing` (83 passed, 8 skipped; total coverage 93% with misses concentrated in `cli.py`, `config.py`, `engine_catalog.py`, `engines.py`, `pipeline.py`, `setup.py`, and integration fixtures.)
- 2025-09-21 05:37 UTC — `uvx mypy .` (72 errors across 20 files; primarily missing third-party stubs for pytest/httpx/tenacity/langcodes/rich plus attr/type issues in `openai_lite.py`, `cli.py`, `tests/test_engines.py`, `tests/test_setup.py`, and examples.)
- 2025-09-21 05:38 UTC — `uvx bandit -r .` (221 Low-severity findings; expected `assert` usage in tests and the `config.py` backup `try/except/pass` guard.)
- 2025-09-21 05:39 UTC — Removed `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.benchmarks`, `.coverage` as part of /cleanup.

### Automated Report – 2025-09-21 (Follow-up)
- 2025-09-21 05:52 UTC — `python -m pytest -xvs` (86 passed, 8 skipped; coverage plugin summary 92% overall. Warnings limited to intentional config reset fallbacks.)
- 2025-09-21 05:53 UTC — `python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing` (86 passed, 8 skipped; total coverage 92% with misses concentrated in `examples/basic_api.py`, CLI/config/setup hot paths, and integration suite skips.)
- 2025-09-21 05:54 UTC — `uvx mypy .` (70 errors, dominated by missing third-party stubs for pytest/httpx/tenacity/langcodes/rich plus stricter Optional handling in CLI/examples.)
- 2025-09-21 05:54 UTC — `uvx bandit -r .` (234 Low-severity findings: intentional `assert` usage throughout tests and the guarded backup writer in `config.py`.)
- 2025-09-21 05:55 UTC — Removed `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.benchmarks`, `.coverage`, `.ruff_cache` during /cleanup.
- 2025-09-21 06:05 UTC — `python -m pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -k unreadable -xvs` validated permission guard raises `PipelineError` for zero-permission files.
- 2025-09-21 06:06 UTC — `python -m pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -k "write_over or dry_run" -xvs` exercised `_persist_output` branches covering write-over and dry-run behaviours.
- 2025-09-21 06:08 UTC — `python -m pytest tests/test_examples.py -xvs` executed mocked example flows; `examples/basic_api.py` coverage climbed to 98%, CLI usage banner verified offline.
- 2025-09-21 06:10 UTC — `python -m pytest -xvs` (96 passed, 8 skipped; total coverage 93% with `examples/basic_api.py` at 98% and `pipeline.py` at 99%).
- 2025-09-21 06:12 UTC — `python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing` (coverage steady at 93%; remaining gaps isolated to CLI/config/setup hot paths and intentionally skipped integrations).
- 2025-09-21 06:14 UTC — `uvx mypy .` (70 errors unchanged, comprised of missing third-party stubs plus attr checks on stubbed engine fixtures.)
- 2025-09-21 06:15 UTC — `uvx bandit -r .` (264 Low-severity findings: expected `assert` statements in tests and backup writer fallback in `config.py`).
- 2025-09-21 06:16 UTC — Removed `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.benchmarks`, `.coverage`, `.ruff_cache` after final test sweep.

### Quality Guardrails Sprint – 2025-09-21
- Added `tests/test_pipeline.py::test_translate_path_handles_mixed_formats` to exercise TXT+HTML flows with the `DummyEngine`, lifting pipeline coverage to 96% and verifying destination paths, chunk metadata, and selector normalization.
- Introduced `examples/basic_api.format_example_doc` with fallback messaging and accompanying `tests/test_examples.py` loader to stop `.strip()` calls on `None` docs; offline example listing now safe and documented.
- Tightened `tests/test_setup.py::test_generate_config_uses_fallbacks` with an explicit credential guard eliminating the prior union-attr mypy warning (remaining failures stem from missing third-party stub packages).
- 2025-09-21 05:46 UTC — `python -m pytest -xvs` (86 passed, 8 skipped; total coverage 91%, new tests passing).
- 2025-09-21 05:48 UTC — `python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing` (86 passed, 8 skipped; coverage steady at 91% with `tests/test_pipeline.py` now 99% covered and `pipeline.py` at 96%).
- 2025-09-21 05:50 UTC — `uvx mypy examples/basic_api.py tests/test_examples.py tests/test_setup.py src/abersetz/setup.py tests/test_pipeline.py` (22 errors, all attributable to missing stubs for httpx/tenacity/pytest/langcodes/rich/semantic-text-splitter and existing openai shims; confirmed the prior union-attr diagnostic cleared.)
- 2025-09-21 05:51 UTC — Removed `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.benchmarks`, `.coverage` after full-suite run.
