### MVP Complete
- Established planning artifacts (`PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`) and refreshed README/CLAUDE alignment.
- Implemented configuration store, chunking utilities, engine adapters, translation pipeline, and Fire CLI.
- Added example assets and comprehensive pytest suite covering config, chunking, engines, pipeline, and CLI wiring.
- Tests: `python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing` (14 tests pass, coverage 91%).
- Fixed pyproject.toml configuration for modern uv/hatch compatibility.

### Quality Improvements (In Progress)
Working on 3 targeted improvements for robustness:

   - Improve error messages when API keys are missing
   - Add helpful suggestions for common configuration mistakes

2. **Network Retry Logic**
   - Add tenacity retry wrapper for translators engine
   - Add retry logic for deep-translator engines
   - Ensure consistent retry behavior across all engines

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Create integration tests for real translation APIs
   - Add pytest markers to skip in CI environments
   - Document how to run integration tests locally
